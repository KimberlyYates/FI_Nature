Finland's forest coverage rate is about 80%, and it is known as the “country of thousands of lakes”. The inland water area accounts for 10% of the national area, with 179,000 islands and 188,000 lakes. The winter is very cold and the summer is mild and short. One third of the country's land is in the Arctic Circle, and the rest is temperate maritime climate. It is precisely because of Finland's superior natural environment. The Finnish country survives more than 1,500 species of natural species.
